					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="secContent">
					<p>Knowing how things work to make my life easier in general, video games are a passion of mine and have always been a driving force behind learning and tinkering with the workings of my computers and systems.<br>
					 Like many people, my original interest in IT was sparked by video games. The family lore is that when I was a baby, I grabbed my grandmas gameboy and started pushing the buttons. I didn't know what they did, but I knew they did something and everyone else seemed to care so I was going to give it a go. Knowing how computers worked meant I could always get my video games to work, and that remains a strong motivator for me to this day.<br>
				  I studied IT in year 11 and 12 (Double majored), and did a games programming course through the AIE, and I spent a year working for a small company as an office admin. Other than that my experience is all hobby based, writing AHK scripts to simplify games, creating mod packages for me and my friends and troubleshooting/fixing compatibility issues etc.<br>
				 I chose RMIT because it offered the kind of degree I'm looking for online, and I'm likely moving to Melbourne in the future.<br>
			 During my studies I expect to learn all the skills necessary to excel in my chosen field (likely softawre engineering or something data) and also many unneccesary skills that are part of some of the courses ;) </p>
