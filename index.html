					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="secContent">
					<p>My interest in IT comes from knowing how things work to make my life easier in general, video games are a passion of mine and have always been a driving force behind learning and tinkering with the workings of my computers and systems.<br> <br>
					 Like many people, my original interest in IT was sparked by video games at a young age. The family lore is that when I was a baby, I grabbed my Nanna's gameboy right out of her hands and started pushing the buttons. I didn't know what they did, but I knew they did something so I was going to give it a go. Knowing how computers worked meant I could always get my video games to work the way I want them to, and that remains a strong motivator for me to this day.<br> <br>
				  I studied IT in year 11 and 12 (Double majored), and did a games programming course through the AIE, and I spent a year working for a small company as an office admin. Other than that my experience is all hobby based, writing AHK scripts to simplify games, creating mod packages for me and my friends and troubleshooting/fixing compatibility issues etc.<br> <br>
				 I chose RMIT because it offered the kind of degree I'm looking for online, and I'm likely moving to Melbourne in the future.<br> <br>
			 During my studies I expect to learn all the skills necessary to excel in my chosen field (likely softawre engineering or something data) and also many unneccesary skills that are part of some of the courses ;) </p>

					<h2>Developer Programmer</h2></a>
					<h3>Job description</h3>
						This job is for an experienced and capable programmer to work in a small team developing websites/apps and data migration. While varied it is not customer facing which is exactly the kind of work I hope to be doing after my education.
					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
						Currently I can only make very basic websites and programs, and a plan to change that.
					<h3>Skills I need</h3>
					They’re asking for a masters  in Software Engineering, Computer Science or other relevant degree and a lot of experience with NetSuite and AngularJS as well as a lot of knowledge on UI/UX and SQL.
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
			 		I will continue my degree and eventually go on to get my masters in software engineering, probably try to find part time work in the field as I go after I get the bachelor prerequisite out of the way.

						<h2>Team Composition</h2>
						Based on these results, my ideal work situation is to work alone or at the head of a team. I work well when able to come up with my own ideas, and work in my own space at my own pace with or without other like minded individuals. I learn best by actually doing a task, so team brainstorming and discussion isn’t usually a useful tool for me. <br>
						Alternatively, working in a team where my role is clearly defined and I don't need to worry about what the other members are doing so much and can instead focus on my own, clearly set goals is another environment in which I am able to thrive.

		<section><!--Project Idea-->
			<article>
				<div class="secTitle">
					<h1>Photo op</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="secContent">
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					A mobile phone app that marks “selfie” locations on a map. Users will be able to identify new spots by uploading their photo and tagging the location. The idea is for users to be able to easily identify fun and interesting places to take photos nearby, for example street art murals, flowers in bloom, cool mirrors in a cafe etc. Users can also rate locations out of 5 stars, and tag identifying features (ie: mirror, art, nature) so locations can be filtered.
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
						Keeping up with social media trends is important to a large chunk of the population. Finding somewhere fun to take photos of yourself and with your friends to post is often a pastime on it’s own. It’s not unusual to see an influencer post a photo in front of a street art mural, for example, and see that location tag on instagram explode in popularity - not because of the specific influencer themselves, they just made the location known, but because people love taking cool photos. This app will be an easier way to immediately know what locations around you could be a good backdrop for your selfies.
					<h2>Description</h2>
					Users upload a photo of a good selfie backdrop and tag the location. They will also be asked to rate it out of 5 stars and tag it according to criteria like type (mirror, mural, nature, art), colours, indoor/outdoor, and accessibility. <br>
					When you open the app it has marked locations nearby. You can change the distance settings, as well as filter locations according to star rating and other criteria.
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					This will most likely be a phone app, cross platform for iOS and Android. Ideally we hook into an existing and popular map application/framework and just build the platform for tagging and sharing locations. We will likely have everything we need for development and testing since it’s unusual for people to not have phones and the dev team will likely have a variety of cells for us to test on.
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					As far as hardware goes we should be okay, for software we will need knowledge on how to build mobile apps that connect to a server which stores profiles and the locations people tag in a fairly robust database.
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
						If the project is successful and the platform takes off, there will likely be a noticable increase in quality to your average selfie posted online. It will also encourage people to get out and find/visit beautiful parts of the places they live or are travelling to.
